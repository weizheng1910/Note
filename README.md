## Why I made this app
Whenever I want to practice playing the violin, I find it troublesome that I have to find my practice journal, my music scores, and my audio recorder before I can start practicing. Thus, I thought of the idea to create a web-based application which have access to these 3 things at once.

## What my app does
This is an app which helps musicians practise purposefully and systematically. Everyday, users will be able to journal their goals and reflection. In each daily entry, they can also submit entries of their audio recordings for them to keep track of their playing, in order to pinpoint ways they can improve on their playing.
